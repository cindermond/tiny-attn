This is the source code of our paper published in EMNLP 2022 **[*Tiny-Attention Adapter: Contexts Are More Important Than the Number of Parameters*](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.444/)**.

To run the code, you need to first install the latest version of PyTorch with cudatoolkit. See the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) for installation instructions.

Then run 
```
pip install .
